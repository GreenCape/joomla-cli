# Joomla Command Line Interface

Joomla CLI (`joomla-cli`) is a tool for managing Joomla from the command line.
It works for all Joomla versions since 1.0.0, although it needs a current PHP installation.

Joomla CLI can be used for [Administration of a Joomla installation](adminstration.md) or for [Joomla Extension Development](development.md).
